# About

This tool helps you create a translation glossary spreadsheet for Korean novels, to improve the quality of your machine translations.



# Requirements

1. **Download** all the files in this repository into a folder on your pc.

2. **Python**: This is a programming language that makes the tool work. You'll need to install it from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to check the 2 boxes that say "Add Python to PATH" and "pip" during installation. This step lets your computer easily find and run the program.

3. **Google API Key**: This is a special password that connects the program to Google's text-reading service. You can get a free one from the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/). Here are the instructions on how to do it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brCkpzAD0gc

4. **Run "setup.py"** by double-clicking it before you proceed to ensure everything is properly set up. You only ever need to run it ONCE. You should see the message "SETUP SUCCESSFUL!" in the command prompt window that pops up.

5.  **(optional) Local Trained Model**: You will need to download a 3 GB file to use the local model (and save AI credits). The download link is: https://mega.nz/file/MvgFGDJJ#YdQxyWAHsBxNGZoraBn336QG5c46gNE18WglfHuzrnc

	

# Instructions

1. Put your novel chapter raws in .txt file format inside a folder and copy it into the main directory. I have provided a folder named "raws" as an example.

2. Start the Program: Find the program file called GLOSSARY_MAKER.py and double click it.

3. Enter Your API Key: When the program opens, you will see that the API key field is blank. You need to fill it with the Google API key you got earlier. This is a crucial step; the tool won't work without it.

4. Configure your custom settings and then hit RUN NOVEL GLOSSARY MAKER to run the code and create your novel translation glossary. Refer to READ ME.pdf to see what each setting does.
